# ExpenseTracker

First full-stack application with Angular/React to track expenses. Currently WIP, but will be able to categorize, visualize, and import data from an excel sheet.

Goal of the project is to fully setup full-stack application using a front end framework like Angular/React, connecting to a back-end service in a technology like NodeJS/Spring Boot/etc. with a DB connection and eventually get setup with a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins/Concourse and deploying it onto AWS.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
