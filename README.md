# ExpenseTracker

First full-stack application with Angular/React to track expenses.
Currently WIP, but will be able to categorize, visualize, and import data from an excel sheet.

Goal of the project is to fully setup full-stack application using a front end framework like Angular/React, connecting
to a back-end service in a technology like NodeJS/Spring Boot/etc. with a DB connection and eventually 
get setup with a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins/Concourse and deploying it onto AWS.
